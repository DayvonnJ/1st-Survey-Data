I believe that with the right mindset, people in need could take away a lot from this program. A feedback I have for SEO Scholars as a whole is that PMs and Instructors a like should set a higher expectation and seriousness for the scholars starting from the 9th grade. I have witnessed too many ""unscholarly"" behavior throughout my time at SEO such as goofing around too much in class, not paying attention, being destructive in hallways and bathrooms, and a subjective one being poor motivation. One of the primary reasons why I joined SEO was for the community. Depsite there obviously being great, motivated, and brilliant scholars, the motivation, maturity, and work ethic of some scholars did not live up to my expectation and I believe that it has stagnated certain people and certain aspects and values of the program. I understand that SEO places a big emphasis on the growth mindset and that I have defineitly noticed that things are getting a lot more strict (I greatly appreciate) but I believe that this should have been happening since the 9th-10th grade, not an exponential spike during the 11th grade."

I liked the addition of the Mathematician's corner in the workbook, but it didn't feel like the overall lessons were engaging for me. Nonetheless, I could see many of my classmates struggling, and I tried to help those that asked for help; albeit there were quite a few people that would rather play games on their laptops than listen to the teacher and would be left clueless by the time we were working on our focus tasks. For the most part, I felt that SEO was a really great community for Freshmen and Sophomore year, but because our groups were changed for Summer Academy, I felt that the relationships and connections I built with my peers was suddenly ripped apart. Now, all of my classes at SEO feel awkward because there are no new connections to be formed; all the cliques have been recreated and I don't feel like being a part of any of them. I feel like this would have worked better on a more outgoing and social group of people, but I don't think the changing of groups was successful for my group.

Although X is a newly appointed PM, I feel like the connections between me and X are not as strong as the connection between me and the previous three PMs."
